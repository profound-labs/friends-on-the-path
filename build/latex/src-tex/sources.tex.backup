Ajahn Sundara's `Freedom within Restraint' and, `Simplicity' have been taken from the collection of nuns' teachings, `Freeing the Heart', which was first sponsored, edited and produced by Richard Smith in 2001. Similarly, the two talks, `Why come to a Monastery' and, `A Question of Balance' from Ajahn Candasiri both came from that same book. `Fearless Presence' is a talk given by Ajahn Sundara at Seattle Insight in 2007 and `The Knowing Mind' is a reflection offered on a ten day retreat she taught in 2009 at Amaravati. Ajahn Candasiri's offering `Jesus through Buddhist eyes' is the transcript of a talk, given as part of the Radio 4 series, `Jesus through many eyes' which was produced by Norman Winter. It is reprinted from `Jesus in the World's Faiths: Leading thinkers from five religions reflect on his meaning', ed. Gregory A. Barker (New York: Orbis, 2008). `Me First' is from a talk by Ajahn Candasiri that appeared originally in `Awakening Presence' -- a collection of nuns' teachings that was sponsored and put together by Sumi Shin.
